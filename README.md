## ABOUT
Last semester I took an introductory class on **Digital Signal Processing**. The lab exercises were tackled mostly via **hands-on audio processing**. Naturally, it sparked an immediate interest for me. I decided to go over the code, adding observations and explanations were I deemed fit. I am looking forward to growing this repository into a **learning resource** that can stand on its own, à la wiki, but with a **practical focus**.

I can not upload the provided lab documents for obvious reason, but the **code should be pretty self-explanatory**. That said, feel free to open up a pull request or to contact me with any inquiries you may have. Beware though, anything outside the scope of this repository will likely escape my understanding of the subject matter.
