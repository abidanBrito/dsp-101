## ABOUT
Last semester I took an introductory class on **Digital Signal Processing**. The lab exercises were tackled mostly via **hands-on audio processing**. Naturally, it sparked an immediate interest for me. I decided to go over the code, adding observations and explanations were I deemed fit. I am looking forward to growing this repository into a **learning resource** that can stand on its own, à la wiki, but with a **practical focus**.

I can not upload the provided lab documents for obvious reason, but the **code should be pretty self-explanatory**. That said, feel free to open up a pull request or to contact me with any inquiries you may have. Beware though, anything outside the scope of this repository will likely escape my understanding of the subject matter.

## CONTENTS

## CONTRIBUTIONS
Please, **don't shy away from making pull requests** with modifications, fixing any mistakes I may have made or adding your own lab exercises / projects.

## REFERENCES
This section is intended to serve as a quick way to familiarize yourself with **common terminology and algorithms** used in DSP.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **Universitat Politècnica de València**, and especially my professor **María Desamparados Girona Coma**, for her outstanding passion for teaching, her encouragement and constant availability throughout the class. This new-found interest of mine is, in a big way, due to her.
